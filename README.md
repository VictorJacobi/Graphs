## A fully functional example app given by the mobile dev community Akure to test how creative a developer is with
##chart implementation.

This project is designed to train myself
on how to build/code out quality charts mainly with the fl_chart. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how
to do the following:

* Graph plotting
* Read local json file of about 8mb linked to project
* Auto populate the graph based on the data in the json file
* Working with isolates or Multithreading in Dart
